# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

In this project I used Bootstrap CSS Framework to rebuild my Portfolio. I also changed the style of the original portfolio making it more visually appealing.

* A skills section with skills I have learned or am expected to learn by the end of the bootcamp.

* A footer section
* Hyperlinks have a hover effect and button a box shadow upon hover

## Usage
My Portfolio has links in the navigation bar which jumps to the corresponding section when clicked. There is also a resume button and link in the about me section which opens a new page with my resume. The portfolio has a brief about me and in the work section cards displaying my projects. Only the first project is currently clickable but in the future more projects will be added so that when clicked a page will open to the corresponding application. The application also has a skills section with the skills and logos of the technologies I expect to learn by the end of the bootcamp. Finally in the contact section my phone number is provided, my email which when clicked directs to your mail to email me directly and my github page with a link. More will be added to the contact section in the future such as a Linkedin page.
